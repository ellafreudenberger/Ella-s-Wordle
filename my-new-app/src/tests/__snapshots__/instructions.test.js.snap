    <p>
      Guess the 5 letter word in 6 guesses. If a letter guessed results in a yellow tile, then the letter is in the wrong order of the right word answer. If a letter guessed results in a green tile, then the letter is in the correct order of the right word answer. If a letter guessed results in a red tile, then the letter is not in the right word answer. If all 5 letters guessed result in green tiles, then the right word has been guessed successfully.
